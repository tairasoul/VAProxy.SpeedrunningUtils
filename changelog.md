# Changelog

Make a few changes to splits

Splits now contain splitHere and addToLayout instead of shouldSplitHere and isFinalSplit

The latter two were not exactly straight forward, while the new ones are.

Please revise any configs you have and update them to work with this version if you're planning to move to 2.0.0
