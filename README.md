# SpeedrunningUtils

Simple speedrunning utils for VA Proxy.

Needs [LiveSplit.Server.Modded](https://github.com/tairasoul/LiveSplit.Server.Modded) to create splits if they aren't there already.

Functionality planned to be finished:

A quick-restart keybind that starts you back at the very beginning
