# SpeedrunningUtils

Simple speedrunning utils for VA Proxy.

The main features don't work yet, so I'll only end up publishing a release when the entire thing works.

Functionality planned to be finished:

Ability to create custom colliders for splits

Ability to create condition-based splits

Abiltiy to combine both

A quick-restart keybind that starts you back at the very beginning
